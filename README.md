# PROJECT ONE - weatherEats

* weatherEats accepts a city name as a user input that is then stored as a variable to then use in our query URL for the Open Weather API.

* After the user hits the enter key or search button, two divs, weather and eats, will appear. 

* The weather div displays the user's city input, the current date, and the temperature provided by the Open Weather API.

* In the eats div, weatherEats will suggest a meal based on the temperature of the given city by accessing the food IDs from the Meal DB API. 

* The user can then click on the card with the food info inside of the eats div and see a small description along with links to either a YouTube video, recipe page, or both.
